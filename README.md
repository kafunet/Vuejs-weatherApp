My idea for the application was to rewrite the application showing the current weather. I wrote earlier versions of the application using only JavaScirpt. As the base framework, I chose Vuejs because I wanted to increase my knowledge about this solution.
The application can show the current weather after entering the city name.
Weather means: city, temperature, wind speed, brief description of the weather, picture showing the status of the weather.
If I had more time I would add the option of showing the weather using the Geolocation API.
